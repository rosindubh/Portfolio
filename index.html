            <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
    <h4>Karate</h4>
    <p>I have been training in a style of karate called Shotokan for 40 years and currently hold a 3rd Degree blackbelt. I won the BSK Shotokan Nationals held in Lincoln in 2008. 
    Coming 1st in Idividual Kata and Team Kumite and 3rd in Individual Kumite.</p>
    <h4>Music</h4>
    <p>I started playing guitar at the age of 16 when several scoolmates formed a band and I noticed how girls were attracted to them. My first guitar cost
    me Â£6.00. It was an awful acoustic instrument with an action that belonged on a chello. In 2013 I finally tracked down the guitar of my dreams a 1973
    Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. This is the make and model used by the gutarist's in Thin Lizzy on there Jailbreak album which was my first introduction to 
    them.</p>
    <h4>Computers</h4>
    <button type="button" onclick="alert('Hello world!')">Click Me!</button>
    <p>I don't know why I became interested in computers they wern't really a thing when I was growing up more science fiction that science fact. I put it
    down to some magazines left in the pub my Mother ran. I read the articles and was facinated with them so I got one for my 20th birthday. This was the
    machine before the BBC Micro and was called the Acorm Atom. I got it in kit form and built it in my bedroom. Acorn if you don't know developed the
    ARM microprocessor, and if you don't know what that is I suggest you Google it, there is almost certainly one in your moble phone.</p>
    <h4>Hi-Fi</h4>
    <p>My other big interest is Hi-Fi. Something lost on most people who use streaming services or listen to Mp3s. The compression on these soundfiles
    means you are missing out on the wonders that the sound engineer spent hours tweaking to give a perfect stereo soundstage. I still listen to vinyl
    and I enjoy it's more relaxing and open sound. I know it lacks the speed and convineince of the digital era, but until you hear a quality Hi-Fi
    system you don't know what you are missing. Believe me you will think you have been listening with cotton wool in your ears when you do.</p>
