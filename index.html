                <h4>Music</h4>
                    <div class="music">
                        <p>I started playing guitar at the age of 16 when several scoolmates formed a band and I noticed how girls were attracted to them. My first guitar cost
                        me Â£6.00. It was an awful acoustic instrument with an action that belonged on a chello. In 2013 I finally tracked down the guitar of my dreams a 1973
                        Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. This is the make and model used by the gutarist's in Thin Lizzy on there Jailbreak album which was my first introduction to 
                        them.</p>
                    </div>
                <h4>Computers</h4>
                    <div class="computers">
                        <p>I don't know why I became interested in computers they wern't really a thing when I was growing up more science fiction than science fact. I put it down to some magazines left in the pub my Mother ran. I read the articles and was facinated  with them so I got one for my 20th birthday. This was the machine before the BBC Micro and was called the Acorm Atom. I got it in kit form and built it in my bedroom. Acorn if you don't know developed the ARM microprocessor, and if you don't know what that is I suggest you Google it, there is almost certainly one in your moble phone.</p>
                    </div>
                <h4>Hi-Fi</h4>
                    <div class="hifi">
                        <p>My other big interest is Hi-Fi. Something lost on most people who use streaming services or listen to Mp3s. The compression on these soundfiles
                        means you are missing out on the wonders that the sound engineer spent hours tweaking to give a perfect stereo soundstage. I still listen to vinyl
                        and I enjoy it's more relaxing and open sound. I know it lacks the speed and convineince of the digital era, but until you hear a quality Hi-Fi
                        system you don't know what you are missing. Believe me you will think you have been listening with cotton wool in your ears when you do.</p>
